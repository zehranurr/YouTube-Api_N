Ada Lovelace Academy Data Science Lessons   Project Day



Hello, in this project, I received the data of a channel using the YouTube API key and examined them by visualizing them. I forwarded the data through the 'schafer5' channel in the YouTube.ipynb file.
Then, I saved the data as 2 files under the schafer5 folder. There is a difference between the publish_date in the first schafer file and the second file. I made minor changes to see it better while visualizing. In the youtube_api.py file, I ran and observed the modules in the methods.py file we created in the lesson.

- To organise
    pip install google-api-python-client
    pip install --upgrade google-api-python client

- Create config folder containing config.py

- Add your YOUTUBE_API_KEY inside config.py
